# Interactive-Student-Faculty-Networking-Platform-DBMS

As the project name _**“Interactive Student Faculty Networking Platform”**_, the idea was to have a platform where the students and the faculty of a particular institution could interact with each other through different events, where any student or faculty can be part of various group any student or faculty can be part of various groups and clubs of their interest.

Research proves that an interactive relation-ship between the students and the faculty results in the benefit of growth in the student's ability to converse as well as to understand any topic being discussed in a deep way and also helps the students to exercise their brains to find many solutions to many computational issues.

**The features of this project were: -**

- Creating an ER Model of the Database.
- Creating a Schema Diagram of the Database.
- Identify Functional Dependencies, normal forms of the relations.
- Discuss the violations when a 2nd normal form, 3rd normal form occurs.
- Identify when violations can happen (when you introduce additional columns).
- Create table scripts, Triggers.
- Run SQL queries relevant to the Database.

**About the project in brief: -**

This project is to build an application to manage a student and faculty profile(s) database. It also helps to support the networking of students, faculties and moderators have discussion forums and clubs. It is a student and Faculty Database managed by students and faculties. A student and faculty must first register before they can use the site. It’s a networking site for the school, where students and faculties can get to know each other and interact. It will act as guidance for the new students to get to know his/her school better and to get familiarized with faculties and other activities. It would be a one stop site, no need of Facebook or LinkedIn to know about a particular person of your school or to get info about a particular event or any restaurant/public place to hang around. People can stay updated of who is doing what like who is attending which seminar, who is doing which project etc.
